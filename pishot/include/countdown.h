 * (`COUNTDOWN_MODE_CONTINUOUS`).
 * 
 * The `handler` parameter specifies which function, if any,
 * should be called when the timer finishes counting down.
 * If this argument is null, no function will be called.
 *
 * The timer does not automatically turn on after init.
 * The default countdown time is the maximum possible until
 * otherwise set by the client.
 *
 * NOTE: For a handler and/or discontinuous mode to work,
 * interrupts must be enabled.
 *
 * When the countdown hits zero, an overflow event
 * happens. If interrupts are enabled, it will also generate an 
 * interrupt on that event. At point of overflow/interrupt,
 * timer will restart counting down if in continuous mode.
